## Durability

Evidence of structural integrity; ability to withstand rigors of competition.

Accomplished: Rare faults/Repairs

Exemplary: Sound Construction; No Repairs

* Does my robot stay together during routine handing?
* Does my robot have excessive flex when moving?
* Do my robot wheels remain in contact with the mat?

 

## Mechanical Efficiency

Economic use of parts and time; easy to repair and modify.

Accomplished: Appropriate use of parts and time to modify/repair

Exemplary: Streamlined Use of Parts and time to repair/modify

* Can the batteries be changed and charged easily?
* Can I see the display screen and push the buttons?
* Can I plug and unplug the wires easily?
* Are the wires in the way?
* Can I identify which wire goes to which port?
* Can attachments be changed easily?
* How long does it take to set up my robot in base?

 

## Mechanization

Ability of robot mechanisms to more or act with appropriate speed, strength, and accuracy for intended tasks (propulsion and execution).

Accomplished: Appropriate balance of speed, strength, and accuracy on most tasks

Exemplary: Appropriate Balance of Speed and Strength on Every Task

Does the robot have the right wheels?

* Big wheels are faster, can move over obstacles,but can be less accurate
* Wider wheels have more friction than skinny tires making turning less repeatable

Where in the Center of Gravity (CG) of the robot?

* Is the robot top heavy?
* How will the robots CG change when it picks uploads? What about with attachments?
* Does the robot avoid tipping on slopes, sharp turns, stops, and in collisions?
* What happens when the robot back up?
